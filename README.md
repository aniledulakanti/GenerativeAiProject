# GenerativeAiProject

I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my groundbreaking Generative AI project and my gratitude towards the NxtWave team and our brilliant mentor, Rahul Attuluri sir, simply cannot be put into words!

I took a deep dive into the world of fastest growing technologies, like Google Colab, PlayHT, Open AI, LongChain, and Gradio softwares.

And that's not all! I explored the A Large Language Model (LLM) technology, The capabilities of Generative AI transported to a whole new dimension of creativity and innovation.
